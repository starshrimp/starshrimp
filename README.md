## Hi 👋

I'm Sarah, a swiss veterinarian turned medical informatician, software engineer and AI enthusias. 
I love working at the intersection of medicine, data and software to build ML models, web tools and research prototypes for real use. I love taking ideas and turning them into something tangible, something people can interact with. 

I love participating in hackathon with friends and am very excited to share my passion for programming with others. When I'm not coding, you will probably find me around my two horses, trying to keep my flat-coated retriever Ylvis from stealing my stuff, or exploring new ideas for fun :).

I enjoy learning new things, collaborating with motivated people and pushing myself to learn new things!

I’m currently working on a multitude of projects; they range from using physiological data to predict lung function in preterm infants, to horse anaesthesia all the way into biopharma.
